## Overview

The "Split The Check" project aims to create a user-friendly application that allows individuals to easily divide their restaurant bills based on the items they consumed. The project emphasizes a smooth and intuitive user experience, from selecting items to finalizing payments.

## Presentation Structure

### 1. Task Flow

- **Initial Task Flow**: The project began with a simple and quick flow designed to get users to the payment stage as efficiently as possible.
- **Final Task Flow**: The final task flow reflects refinements and improvements made based on user feedback and testing.

### 2. Concepts and Initial Thoughts

- The initial design focused on creating a straightforward flow that makes it easy for users to reach the payment stage quickly.
- Considerations included the ability to divide items among participants and ensuring clear distinctions between participants.

### 3. Decision Points

Key decision points in the user journey include:
- How to receive the bill and choose items.
- How to divide items and payments.
- When to move to the payment screen.

### 4. Personas

The project considered a persona aged 25-30 with a modest income level. The persona’s behavior and needs informed the design decisions.

### 5. Scenario

The user scenario involved the persona dining at a restaurant with three friends, where they decided to pay for the items they individually consumed. The scenario also included adding a tip via Apple Pay.

### 6. Experiment Results

Results from testing with the persona showed:
- Users generally understood the task flow.
- Some areas of the interface were unclear, such as waiting times and item selection screens.

### 7. Conclusions and Changes

Based on user feedback, several changes were made:
- **Adding Titles**: Clear titles were added to each product, along with prices and checkboxes for selection.
- **Improving the Wait Indicator**: A GIF was added to indicate waiting, along with more explicit instructions.
- **Adding a Back Button**: A button was added to allow users to return to the selection screen if needed.

### 8. Final Product

The final product incorporates the changes made during the testing phase and aims to deliver a seamless experience for users looking to split their restaurant bills.

### 9. Acknowledgments

The project was presented by Sagiv Antebi and Niv Nachman.

## Conclusion

The "Split The Check" project successfully created a functional and user-friendly application for bill splitting. The iterative process of testing and refinement ensured that the final product met user needs effectively.
